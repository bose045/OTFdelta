run the job_sequence_npl.sh for iteration zero (starts with NNMD)

for all other iterations, 
1. first run "dcs_prelaunch.sh iter_number" to generate valid aimd run directories and then "dcs_array_aimd.sh iter_number" to launch all the aimd jobs 
2. run "job_sequence_npl_1.sh iter_number" to do- postprocess aimd data, taking mace delta, training, inference, select and prepare AIMD candidates sequentially
